Step 3: Creating Demogrphic Distribution Figure
This figure shows a distribution of the number of patients included in our study across all cancer types. If you want the files to be in a specific folder then you can use the second cell to choose a file name and destination. 
Run all of the cells without customizing to save "Demographics" within the "Figures" folder. 

Step 4: Creating Figure 1: a plot of the distribution of individual trait scores and an overall score.
The figure shows a distribution of scores across chosen traits and the overall score. Use the first cell to customize the file names and locations. 
Run all cells without updating them to save "Figure 1" to the "Figures" folder. 

Step 5: Creating Figure 2: a plot that shows the percent of patients that would be likely to respond very well, and just well to ASMase therapy. 
The figure displays the percent of patients that score above the 50th percentile across all cancer types with a grey bar. Patients who score above the 80th percentile across all cancer types are contained within the blue bar. Use the second cell of the notebook to customize file name and location. 
Run all cells without updating them to save "Figure 2"  to the "Figures" folder.
